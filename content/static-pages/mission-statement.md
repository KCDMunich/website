## Cloud Native Summit Munich

CNS Munich is a community-driven event that aims to bring together cloud native enthusiasts from around the region to learn, share knowledge, and network with each other. We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for attendees of all experience levels, from beginners to experts. Our goal is to promote the adoption of cloud-native technologies and to provide a platform for community members to share their experiences and best practices. We believe in the power of collaboration and community to drive innovation and the future of cloud computing.

Additionally, we are committed to being a carbon-neutral event and will work to offset any carbon emissions associated with the event through environmentally-conscious initiatives. In line with our commitment to sustainability, we will only serve vegetarian and vegan food options at the event. Furthermore, we are committed to reducing trash as much as possible at the event and will encourage the use of reusable containers and other eco-friendly practices. Above all, we embrace diversity and inclusivity and welcome attendees from all backgrounds and identities to join us at CNS Munich.

## Old wine in new bottles

What's the difference between KCD Munich and CNS Munich? Nothing. Same organization team, same community, same location. But ...

We have organized the KCD Munich now 3 years in a row and have grown in a healthy, dynamic way to an event with over 420 participants. And we are not alone; KCDs all around the globe become major successes. This very drastic growth in the last years requires some guiding frames, which were implemented in the last year by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). However, those frames are no help for outgrown events like ours.

Therefore, we decided not to apply for the KCD program and stay independent but united with all other European KCDs who take a similar approach. We strongly believe that the unclaimed resources of us can be used by fresh new KCDs somewhere around the globe better; so, go and make it work in your country too!

### More than Kubernetes - a Cloud Native Summit

The decision to not take part in the KCD 2.0 program has come a long way, with dozens of discussions, meetings, and reflections. We came to the conclusion that the community itself gives the success of the event, the speaker, the sponsors, and the magic in between all of it. We aim to bring together the best, most curious, deepest tech, and craziest innovative mindset people – a summit. Our vision is to encourage and support the open-source community, build on the cloud-native ecosystem, and foster collaboration between all parties.

### Double down on the community

We would like to use this change to put ourselves on a solid base for the future. Therefore, we have decided to found a non-profit organization (Förderverein für Cloud-Native und Open-Source Bayern e.V) to host any future Cloud Native Summits starting with the 2025 edition.

### Onwards and Upwards

Only those who dream big will reach something great. The next few months we will throw ourselves into the planning for CNS Munich 2025. Follow us on LinkedIn, X/Twitter, or Instagram to stay up to date.
