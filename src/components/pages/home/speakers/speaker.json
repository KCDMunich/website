        "description": "\"Cloud Native is eating the world\". The same happens with the domain of automation, including continuous integration tools. There are many open-source CI tools or open-source ecosystems on the market, cloud native or not: Jenkins, Argo, Woodpecker, Flux, GitLab, Dagger, Tekton, etc. There are many generations of these tools, with their architectures and use cases. We will talk about these tools and the evolution of the existing projects towards the next generation - AI-native CI tools.\r\n\r\nWhat has changed in CI since cloud native became popular 10y ago? How do Open Source, CNCF, CDF impact the landscape? What's next for the tools:  cloud native dev environments, developer experience, machine learning, fuzzing and predictive testing, etc.? And what does AI bring into the next generation of tools and sustainability?",

A well-designed app scales up and down as demand increases and decreases, and is resilient enough to withstand service disruptions.\r\n\r\nA resilient app is one that continues to function despite failures of system components. Resilience requires planning at all levels of your architecture. It influences how you lay out your infrastructure and network and how you design your app and data storage. Resilience also extends to people and culture.\r\n\r\nBuilding and operating resilient apps is hard. This is especially true for distributed apps, which might contain multiple layers of infrastructure, networks, and services. Mistakes and outages happen, and improving the resilience of your app is an ongoing journey. With careful planning, you can improve the ability of your app to withstand failures. With proper processes and organizational culture, you can also learn from failures to further increase your app's resilience.\r\n\r\nTesting resiliency for an application is equally important and key to success.\r\n\r\nI will be talking on best practices for building resilient Cloud apps through my experience and also how you can test resiliency using Chaos Engineering.\r\n\r\nHigh level Agenda\r\n\r\n1) Embracing Failure at Scale\r\n2) Avoiding Cascading Failures\r\n3) Preventing Service Failure with Health Check\r\n4) Caching for resiliency\r\n5) Chaos Engineering Experiments\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ",

As organizations increasingly adopt serverless computing for its scalability and flexibility, securing these architectures becomes a critical priority. The session will explore strategies for building highly secure and resilient serverless systems, with an emphasis on comprehensive security measures from the network perimeter all the way through the application layer.\r\n\r\nA key area of focus will be perimeter security, highlighting how to protect serverless environments from external threats and unauthorized access. We will discuss how to implement robust network boundaries, secure traffic flows, and protect against common attack vectors spanning from Layer 3 (network layer) through to Layer 7 (application layer). This includes techniques for defending against DDoS attacks, network-based threats, and more advanced application-level attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other vulnerabilities that can compromise the integrity of RESTful APIs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to perimeter security, the talk will cover best practices for ensuring high availability and fault tolerance in serverless systems. We will address how to design microservice architectures that are resilient to both external and internal failures, ensuring business continuity even in the face of unexpected events. Automation of security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response will also be discussed, empowering attendees to build proactive defenses and rapidly respond to emerging threats.\r\n\r\nTargeted at DevOps professionals, security engineers, and cloud architects, this session aims to provide actionable insights into securing serverless applications in the modern cloud landscape.

        "description": "Performance optimization makes you a 10x software engineer. You can help your company save money or serve more customers with the same resources. It is a mandatory skill on the resume if you want to stand out from the crowd. By optimizing performance, you also gain a deeper understanding of how the Go runtime works under the hood, making you more performance-oriented when writing Go code.\r\n\r\nThis session shows you how to optimize your Go code from a CPU and memory perspective.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, performance optimization is not a trivial or straightforward process. Whenever a software engineer wants to optimize code, he often stumbles across several terms such as profiling, tracing, latency, throughput, Garbage Collector, heap, stack, etc. These terms can easily create confusion and headaches.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever experienced this pain or want to avoid it in the future, this session comes to the rescue.\r\n\r\nWe start with their definitions and usages so we all speak the same language throughout the session.\r\n\r\nThen, we explore the performance optimization process. It's an iterative process involving studying, benchmarking, changing code, benchmarking (again), comparing, and deciding. Thanks to this session, you'll learn to go through this process without getting lost.\r\n\r\nYou'll understand that performance optimization is not just about changing source code. It's a journey. And before embarking on it, you need everything ready and set.\r\n\r\nWe'll also cover the importance of understanding collected metrics and values and how to use them to evaluate potential code changes. I will show you how to capture a snapshot of your program's state and analyze it effectively.\r\n\r\nThen, we explore the tools Go provides for performance analysis.

However, existing implementations typically sample only 1-5% of traces due to storage and scalability constraints, leading to a biased representation that favors normal execution flows. This skew impedes effective troubleshooting. Our solution leverages Machine Learning and Cognitive techniques to dynamically adjust the sampling rate based on real-time system behavior, prioritizing high-value traces related to failures or anomalies. This adaptive approach has significantly reduced Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) for SRE teams by improving root cause identification. The Adaptive Sampling algorithm, driven by data analysis, ensures balanced trace distribution, reduces storage overhead, optimizes resource utilization, and enhances trace metric analysis, offering a scalable solution to challenges in observability and system performance management.",

We typically see organisations stumble through accelerating development, implementing DevOps before pivoting to SRE. They copy what other organisations have done by implementing a Cloud Center of Excellence or adopting other models for merging development and operating functions. Eventually as the challenges around \"You build it, you run it\" become clearer a platform emerges. But how do these chaotic transformations lead to this convergence? Whether your platform serves developers or customers the foundational concepts heavily align. In this talk we'll look at the ways platforms emerge and the key considerations necessary for one to succeed. As we go through time to understand how convergence happens we will examine carcinisation and what elements of it can help us understand how organisations converge on a similar approach.",

        "description": "Autoscaling in Kubernetes can be significantly simpler when you have the right tools to help you. Who doesn’t want a highly efficient Kubernetes cluster? You, me, and even our planet. The novel approach of Karpenter for node autoscaling helps many organisations reduce their spending by up to 70% on their cloud infrastructure. KEDA as an established standard for pod scaling plays an equally important role in the autoscaling ecosystem. How can these two technologies work together for even greater efficiency? This session offers practical insights from KEDA and Karpenter contributors into the current state of autoscaling, and it will give you a set of useful recommendations you can apply after leaving the conference.",

Kubernetes appeared to be the best option, but getting to Kubernetes was the real challenge.\r\n\r\nThis session will discuss the entire journey of our migration endeavor, from the nine-month conversion phase to the ongoing challenges encountered in the post-migration landscape. Topics discussed will be migrating existing customers, cloud infrastructure, creating efficient deployment strategies, and fine-tuning resource allocation to align with individual customer usage patterns.\r\n\r\nWith our new managed services architecture and Kubernetes, we are able to easily onboard 100s of new customers per month with little to no adjustments to our platform.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways for Attendees:\r\n- Insights into the rationale behind transitioning from EC2 instances to Kubernetes.\r\n- The rationale behind opting for managed services for our database and file storage needs.\r\n- Challenges encountered during the transition from hosting on Windows to a Linux-based container environment.\r\n- Navigating deployment challenges, leveraging \"dogfooding\" strategies, and implementing release rings.\r\n- Techniques for dynamically adjusting CPU and RAM resources based on customer usage metrics.",

For example:\r\n\r\nBug or hotfix comes through and you want to start working on it right away so you create a branch and start fixing. What you don’t do is create a Jira ticket but then later your boss/PM/CSM yells at your due to lack of visibility.

I share an ML job I wrote that tells me how long the review will take so I can pick PRs that fit the amount of time I have.\r\n\r\nYou build. You ship it. You own it. Great.

        "description": "This is the case study of how we changed how we ship software. \r\n\r\nWith thousands of customers, each in their own Kubernetes container, deploying updates was tough. Off-hours schedules meant it took over 24 hours to push a new version. If something broke, we had to scramble. Canary deployments let us update small groups of customers at a time. We built a tool to stop rollouts fast when issues appeared, limiting the damage.\r\n\r\nIn the past, new features went to everyone at once. Rolling back wasn't an option.  If something failed it'd leave customers stuck in the mess. Now, using OpenFeature, we hide new functionality behind feature flags. We release features to small groups, gather feedback, and test internally for weeks. If things go wrong, we flip the flag off and move on.\r\n\r\nThis two-pronged approach lets us avoid risky big-bang releases. We went from deploying every 10 days to every 4, with fewer than 1% high-severity defects.  Most of these are resolved before customers notice them.",

But as we step into 2025, we have to ask—did we get what we signed up for? Or did we just trade one set of problems for another, wrapped in YAML?\r\n\r\nThis talk takes a real, unfiltered look at the state of service mesh in 2025. What actually changed with Ambient Mesh? Did getting rid of sidecars really make life easier, or did we just move the pain to a place we haven’t noticed yet? And what about Cilium and eBPF—is this the revolution we were promised, or just a different kind of complexity with a fancier name?\r\n\r\nWe’ll talk zero trust, because apparently, nothing—not even our own services—deserves faith anymore. We’ll look at the great migration away from sidecars, and whether it’s leading us to a golden age of networking or just another round of debugging nightmares at 3 a.m.\r\n\r\nThis session is part technical review, part retrospective, and all brutal honesty—with a touch of humor to help us all cope. Whether you love service mesh, hate it, or are just trying to survive it, you’ll walk away with a better understanding of where we are, how we got here, and what it all really means.",

They can adapt to changes and learn from interactions, allowing to produce more nuanced and contextually relevant outputs. Multi-agent systems are revolutionising the execution of tasks, facilitating more intelligent, rapid and effective workflows.\r\n\r\nPartnering with AWS has fostered our efforts to deploy the Network Assistant, a multi-agent genAI application based in AWS Bedrock able to retrieve data from network entities of multiple data sources and analyse the telemetry metrics to check for compliance, thresholds and faulty elements. The main aim is to eliminate the need for manually checking each of the data sources, provide a clear understanding of network parameters and their correct performance conditions and offer Swisscom engineers valuable insights out of the data.\r\n\r\nHow are we making the most out of AWS powered Generative AI? Leveraging multiple agents and action groups has allowed to combine diverse data sources and capabilities, while tackling complex tasks and calculations that involve data engineering processes more effectively. This collaboration enhanced the adaptability and responsiveness of our Network Assistant, enabling for richer context-aware outputs and more accurate responses avoiding taking relevant vector embeddings for granted.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in:\r\n- Generative AI in AWS environment applied to a big telco.\r\n- AWS Bedrock: our use of knowledge bases, agents and action groups, among other features.\r\n- How data engineering can blend into Generative AI.\r\n\r\nDo not hesitate to tune in! 🚀",

Ditch runners pain!\r\nManaging EC2 instances for GitHub Actions runners within your VPC is a major headache: scaling is time-consuming, costly, and introduces operational overhead.\r\n\r\nUnmaintained pipelines leading to frustrating delays, creates bottlenecks with the release velocity, and tempting developers to bypass the system with manual deployments. This slows down innovation and increases the risk of errors.\r\nIn this talk you will learn how to streamline your CI/CD process and boost developer morale by leveraging CodeBuild's fully managed, serverless environment to execute your GitHub Actions workflows. We'll walk through a real-world migration from a self-managed EKS-based solution to CodeBuild Managed Runners, showcasing key configuration steps, best practices, and addressing common pitfalls.\r\n\r\nYou'll discover how this integration simplifies infrastructure management, enhances security with native AWS IAM and VPC integration, and dramatically improves operational efficiency. Eliminate the pain of runners and custom images, freeing your DevOps teams to focus on delivering value and empowering developers to trust the pipeline.\r\nThis session is tailored for DevOps engineers, DevOps Managers, platform architects, and anyone interested in building scalable, secure and resilient CI/CD.",

        "description": "Imagine building a platform that starts small—clean, efficient, and focused. But as adoption grows, external teams begin knocking: “Can we integrate Feature X?” “How about supporting Protocol Y?” Each request feels urgent, and saying “no” isn’t an option. Before long, your core platform risks becoming a tangled mess of custom integrations, slowing development to a crawl.\r\n\r\nThis is where the Echidna architecture shines. Inspired by the spiny mammal’s adaptive defenses, the pattern encourages wrapping your core platform with modular “spikes”—lightweight APIs and hooks that act as controlled entry points. Instead of bending your platform to meet every external demand, you let stakeholders plug into these spikes. Need to support a new API standard? Add a spike. A third-party tool integration? Another spike. The core remains untouched, stable, and fast.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll walk through:\r\n\r\n* The inflection point: When scaling demands force teams to choose between speed and flexibility\r\n* Spikes in action: How APIs and hooks create safe, scalable interaction layers\r\n* Real-world lessons: Balancing stakeholder needs without technical debt\r\n* The payoff: Faster iterations, happier developers, and a platform that evolves with its ecosystem\r\n\r\nBy the end, you’ll see how Echidna turns integration chaos into a structured, sustainable strategy—keeping your platform nimble, no matter how many requests come knocking.",

        "description": "In modern software engineering, monitoring your own systems is already a standardised and interchangeable commodity best purchased cheaply from experts. \r\n\r\nHowever, everyone has probably heard a joke at some point about how expensive these monitoring services can become once a system reaches a certain size. So would you rather build it yourself?\r\n\r\nBut as the complexity of your own systems increases, so does the effort of your monitoring stack - right up to the organisational question: Is monitoring just one component in every team or is it a separate product after all?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will therefore use the monitoring story of a B2B Kubernetes Cluster Fleet Management Platform (because why not a super complex system?) to explore how the commodity monitoring can be successfully organised across several teams and effectively deliver added value with product thinking and platform patterns, even to the end customer.

In 2014 he joined the CTO office of a fast-moving cloud security startup, which later was acquired by a networking giant. At this startup he also met Ori Keren and Dan Lines, now co-founders of LinearB. He joined them shortly after the company was established, in order to get back to what he loves most about engineering, solving big challenges, and this time he is focusing on the world of Dev Productivity and Experience.  He is also the host of the very successful Hebrew Podcast - Dev Interrupted. ",
